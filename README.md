# LinkedIn Jobs Analysis Project

This repository contains an end-to-end analysis of LinkedIn's professional networking platform's Jobs section. The project involves data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) using the Pandas and Numpy libraries. Additionally, MySQL and MS-Excel were utilized to derive further insights from the dataset, and Power BI was used to visualize the results.

## Data Cleaning and EDA

The data cleaning and exploratory data analysis were performed using the Pandas library. The dataset was imported from CSV files, and various data cleaning techniques were employed to ensure the data's quality and consistency. Exploratory data analysis techniques were used to gain insights into the dataset, identify trends, and understand the distribution of job opportunities and applicant skills.

## MySQL Analysis

The cleaned dataset was seamlessly imported into MySQL for comprehensive analysis. SQL clauses such as GROUP BY, ORDER BY, HAVING, CASE-WHEN, and more were skillfully employed to manipulate the data and enable in-depth analysis. This allowed for the extraction of valuable insights, particularly regarding the correlation between specific skills and job positions available in the market.

## Insights and Results

The project provides valuable insights into the job opportunities available on LinkedIn's platform, specifically focusing on the skill sets required for different positions. Some of the key findings and visualizations include:

- An overview of job opportunities that specifically require particular skill sets, highlighting the demand for expertise in certain areas.
- A comparison of job postings between small-size, medium-size, and large-size companies, along with the number of applicants for each category.
- Geographical analysis of job applications and postings, showcasing the cities and states with the highest job opportunities and applicant activities.
- An analysis of the industry sectors with the most job openings and the required skill sets for those positions.

## Power BI Dashboard

An interactive Power BI dashboard was developed to consolidate data from multiple sources. The dashboard includes visually engaging charts, graphs, and tables, enabling users to explore key metrics and extract valuable insights interactively. This dashboard enhances data-driven decision-making and facilitates effective communication with stakeholders.

## Conclusions

Based on the analysis, the following conclusions were drawn:

- Most jobs are being posted by small-size companies, but applicants are primarily applying to large-size companies.
- Chennai-based companies receive the highest number of applications, but more job opportunities are available in Mumbai and Bangalore-based companies.
